#Accesing the Address

num = 10
a = 10
b = 8

#print(num)
#print(str(num))
print(id(num)) #the adress of a and num will be simillar since they both point to the same value 10
print(id(a)) #Python is memory efficient
print(id(b)) #the address is different from the two because it oints to another value.
